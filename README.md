# MERN Workout App

This Workout project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application for managing workouts. It provides a user-friendly interface for tracking workouts, enhancing fitness routines. The app features secure user authentication, workout creation, editing, and deletion (CRUD operations). Each userâ€™s data is stored independently, ensuring privacy and personalized access.


## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login/logout with JWT-based authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their workouts.

- **Workout Management**: Add, update, and delete workouts. Each workout includes details such as title, load, and reps.

- **User-Specific Workouts**: Each user's workouts are uniquely associated with their ID in MongoDB, ensuring that users can only view and manage their own workouts.

- **Data Privacy and Security**: By associating workouts with user IDs, data privacy is maintained. Only authenticated users can create, access, or manipulate their workouts, protecting sensitive data.

- **API Route Protection**: The app uses middleware to verify user identity before allowing access to any workout-related operations, preventing unauthorized access.

- **Multi-User System**: Supports multiple users independently, providing each user with a personalized workout history and ensuring scalability across users.

- **Responsive UI**: Built with React, the application features a clean interface for easy user interaction and responsive design.

- **Error Handling and Validation**: Provides validations for required fields and displays error messages for failed actions, creating a smoother user experience.


## Project Structure
The project is structured into frontend and backend sections. The backend manages API endpoints and database interaction, while the frontend handles user interaction and interface:


### Backend Structure
- **`server.js`**: Initializes the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and sets up routes and middleware.

- **`middleware/requireAuth.js`**: Auth middleware to protect routes; verifies the user's JWT token.

- **`routes/`**:
  - `workouts.js`: Manages CRUD routes for workouts.
  - `user.js`: Manages user authentication (signup and login).

- **`models/`**:
  - `workoutModel.js`: Defines the MongoDB schema for workouts.
  - `userModel.js`: Defines the MongoDB schema for users.

- **`controllers/`**:
  - `workoutController.js`: Contains logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting workouts.
  - `userController.js`: Handles user registration and login.


### Frontend Structure
- **`App.js`**: The main application component, handles route definitions.

- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components, including:
  - `Navbar.js`: Header with navigation links.
  - `Footer.js`: Footer component.
  - `Spinner.js`: Displays a loading spinner during data fetches or actions.
  - `WorkoutDetails.js`: Displays workout information.
  - `CreateWorkout.js` and `UpdateWorkout.js`: Forms to add and edit workouts. 

- **`pages/`**:
  - `Home.js`: Main dashboard displaying all workouts.
  - `ManageWorkout.js`: Workout-specific management page.
  - `Signup.js` and `Login.js`: Authentication pages.
  - `NotFound.js`: Error page for undefined routes.

- **`context/`**: Context and reducer functions for state management, including:
  - `AuthContext.js`: Authenticates users across the app.
  - `WorkoutsContext.js`: Manages CRUD actions on workouts.

- **`hooks/`**: 
  - **`useAuthContext.js`** and **`useWorkoutsContext.js`**: Provides global state management for authentication and workout data.
  - **`useSignup.js`**: Handles user signup, managing the backend API request and state.
  - **`useLogin.js`**: Manages user login, handling API requests, state, and session persistence.
  - **`useLogout.js`**: Handles user logout, clearing local storage, and updating app state.
  - **`useCreateWorkout.js`**: Manages API calls and state for creating new workouts.
  - **`useFetchWorkouts.js`**: Fetches and manages data for all workouts specific to the user.
  - **`useFetchSingleWorkout.js`**: Fetches and manages data for a single workout, handling loading and error states.
  - **`useUpdateWorkout.js`**: Manages updating a workout, handling API calls and state updates. 
  - **`useDeleteWorkout.js`**: Handles workout deletion, interacting with the backend and updating app state.


## Routes

### Frontend Routes
- **`/signup`**: Signup page for new users.
- **`/login`**: Login page for existing users.
- **`/`**: Displays the user's workouts (requires authentication).
- **`/:id`**: Manages a specific workout with options to edit or delete.

### Backend API Endpoints

### User Routes :
  - **POST** `/api/user/signup`: Registers a new user.
  - **POST** `/api/user/login`: Authenticates an existing user and returns a JWT.

### Workout Routes (Protected) :
  - **GET** `/api/workouts`: Retrieves all workouts for the authenticated user.
  - **POST** `/api/workouts`: Creates a new workout.
  - **GET** `/api/workouts/:id`: Retrieves a specific workout.
  - **PATCH** `/api/workouts/:id`: Updates a specific workout.
  - **DELETE** `/api/workouts/:id`: Deletes a specific workout.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - React Router DOM
  - CSS for styling

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (with Mongoose)
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

- **Environment**:
  - dotenv for environment variable management


## MongoDB
- The project uses MongoDB as the database to store the workout data and user information. Thus, there are two main collections in the MongoDB database:

1- **users**
2- **workouts**
